# Prob-ml-reading
I am reading the great book of [Probabilistic machine learning by Kevin Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) and will use this repository to document my solutions to the unsolved exercies in the book. 
As these are my personal solutions, they might not be perfect. I hope this turns out to be a helpful resource to whoever is reading the book and I welcome any feedback or extra contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests.

Happy learning!

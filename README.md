# Probabilistic Machine Learning - solutions to starred exercises
I am reading the great book of [Probabilistic machine learning by Kevin Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) and will use this repository to document my solutions to the unsolved (starred) exercies in the book. 

As these are my personal solutions, they might not be perfect. I hope this turns out to be a helpful resource and I welcome any feedback or extra contributions via GitHub issues and pull requests.

Happy learning!
